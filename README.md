Project Title: Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography
This project focuses on the concept of hiding sensitive data within images using steganography, ensuring secure message delivery and maintaining confidentiality.

Steps to Set Up and Run the Project:
Install Python and IDLE:

Download and install Python IDE (IDLE) from the official website if you haven't already.
Install Required Libraries:

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the required OpenCV library:
nginx
Copy
pip install opencv-python
Download the Project Files:

Go to the provided GitHub link to download the project ZIP file.
Set Up Your Project Folder:

Create a new folder where you'll extract the downloaded ZIP file.
Extract the contents of the ZIP file into the folder.
Inside the extracted folder, you will find the Python code for the project.
Create Encryption and Decryption Files:

Create two Python files:
One for encryption, which will handle the data hiding process.
Another for decryption, which will extract the hidden data from the image.
(Optional) Create a GUI Interface:

You can create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the data hiding process, making the tool more user-friendly and accessible.
Why is this Project Important?
This project enables secure communication by embedding sensitive information in image files. The hidden data can only be accessed with the proper decryption mechanism, ensuring confidentiality and secure message delivery.
