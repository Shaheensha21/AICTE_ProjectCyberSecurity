Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography
Overview

This project presents a secure approach to hiding sensitive information inside digital images using steganography techniques. The embedded data remains imperceptible to the human eye, ensuring confidentiality and secure message transmission. The hidden information can only be accessed through an authorized decryption process.

Project Objectives

Securely embed confidential data within image files

Maintain privacy and confidentiality during data transmission

Enable reliable extraction of hidden data using decryption techniques

Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV

Image Processing

Steganography

Installation and Setup
Prerequisites

Python (IDLE or any Python IDE) must be installed.
Download Python from the official website:
https://www.python.org/

Install Required Libraries

Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

pip install opencv-python

Project Setup

Download the project ZIP file from the GitHub repository

Create a new directory on your system

Extract the contents of the ZIP file into the directory

Navigate to the extracted folder containing the Python source files

Project Structure
├── encryption.py   # Handles embedding secret data into images
