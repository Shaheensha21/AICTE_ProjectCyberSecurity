🖼️ Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography
🧠 Overview

A cybersecurity and image processing project focused on securely embedding sensitive information into digital images using steganography. The hidden data remains invisible to the human eye and can only be accessed through authorized decryption, ensuring confidential communication.

🎯 Objectives

Securely embed confidential data inside image files

Maintain privacy and confidentiality during data transmission

Enable reliable extraction of hidden data using decryption techniques

⚙️ Techniques Used

Steganography for data embedding

Image processing with OpenCV

Python scripting for encryption and decryption

🧪 Workflow

Input sensitive data → Embed in image using encryption.py → Share steganographic image → Extract hidden data using decryption.py

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python, OpenCV, Image Processing, IDLE/Python IDE

📁 Project Structure
encryption.py   # Embeds secret data into images
decryption.py   # Extracts hidden data from images
(Optional) GUI  # User-friendly interface for encryption/decryption

📦 Installation & Setup

Install Python from https://www.python.org/

Install required library: pip install opencv-python

Download the project ZIP from GitHub

Extract contents into a new folder

Open the folder in Python IDE

📈 Outcomes

Secure message embedding and retrieval demonstrated

Data remains hidden from unauthorized viewers

Practical application of steganography and cybersecurity concepts

Suitable for secure messaging, digital forensics, and data protection

🔮 Future Enhancements

Develop a graphical user interface (GUI)

Support additional image formats

Improve encryption strength for enhanced security
